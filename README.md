## Questions

### Remote file browsers such as [Filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) already exists, why make another one?

I wanted to gain some more programming experience doing this kind of thing, I
also happen to have my own server which at the time of development, doesn't
really have anything running on it. Then I thought I could start making some
projects of my own that would be useful to me if I host it on the server.

### How do I set this up with [Nginx](https://nginx.org)?

I recommend using the https://nginxconfig.io website. It has an easy UI to
navigate and many options to customize. In the reverse proxy tab, select the
`enable reverse proxy` option and put in your address and port in the
`proxy_pass` field. After that you can follow the installation instructions
listed on the "Setup" section.

### How to enable SSL/TLS?

Set `ENABLE_SSL: true` and `SSL_CERTS_FOLDER: "/path/to/certificates/"` in your
`config.json`. The `SSL_CERTS_FOLDER` key must contain the path to a valid
directory with `fullchain.pem` and `privkey.pem` files in it. To use
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) certificates, generate them and set
`SSL_CERTS_FOLDER` to `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com` where `example.com`
is replaced by your domain name.

### Can I make my own frontend?

Sure thing, but currently there is no documentation on the Bunsho API. But I
won't stop you if you want to try and read the source to figure out the
endpoints for yourself :).
